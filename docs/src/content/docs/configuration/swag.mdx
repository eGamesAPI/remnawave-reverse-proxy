Criticism is not welcome (read below) as it is our personal preference on how we configure our setup. However, I appreciate any feedback for IMPROVING it!

First, you need to decide whether you want to use [SWAG](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag) or stick with the default nginx configuration. SWAG (Secure Web Application Gateway) is a popular and easy choice for reverse proxy setups, especially when you've got a lot of stacks/containers to manage. It comes with built-it cert renewal, templates for various containers, which are a bit changed for beginner-friendly experience. SWAG is same nginx you familiar with (watch the pic below), but with some extra features and easier configuration.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important" icon="seti:todo">
  You can't use SWAG if you installed Panel and Node on one machine. Panel and node installation uses nginx.sock, but for some reason I didn't manage to make SWAG remove it, so you don't have to manually stop it. Otherwise it will give you a message that sock is already used.

## Installing SWAG

<Steps>

1. Create a directory for SWAG.

    ```bash
    mkdir /opt/swag
    ```

2. Create a docker compose file.

    ```bash
    nano docker-compose.yml
    ```

    ```yml
    swag:
      image: lscr.io/linuxserver/swag:latest
      container_name: swag
      cap_add:
        - NET_ADMIN
      environment:
        - PUID=1000
        - PGID=1000
        - TZ=Etc/UTC
        - URL=domain.com
        - VALIDATION=dns
        - SUBDOMAINS=wildcard
        - DNSPLUGIN=cloudflare
        - PROPAGATION=60
        - SWAG_AUTORELOAD=true
      volumes:
        - /path/to/swag:/config
      restart: unless-stopped
      networks:
        - remnawave-network

    networks:
      remnawave-network:
        name: remnawave-network
          driver: bridge
          external: true
    ```

      I guess optional, but can be added

    ```yml
      logging:
        driver: 'json-file'
        options:
          max-size: '30m'
          max-file: '5'
    ```

3. Generate a Cloudflare [API token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) with `DNS:Read`, `DNS:Edit` permissions to `domain.com` and copy the token.

4. Edit `/path/to/swag/dns-conf/cloudflare.ini`, delete everything and paste the following with your token:

    ```ini
    dns_cloudflare_api_token = token
    ```

5. Delete nginx section in `/opt/remnawave/docker-compose.yml` and stop the stack.

    ```bash
    cd /opt/remnawave && docker compose down
    ```

6. Start the stack and monitor logs, we'll need them in a second.

    ```bash
    cd /opt/swag && docker compose up -d && docker compose logs -f -t
    ```

    In case you've done everything right "Server ready." will pop up in logs and make sure that `domain.com` shows the welcome page with a valid certificate. But we also need logs for monitoring autoreload logs in case you've done mistakes in proxy-conf.

</Steps>

## Configuring SWAG

Now we need to implement the nginx configuration we had for SWAG to work with remnawave panel & nodes.

<Steps>

1. Copy template for remnawave

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/swag/config/nginx/proxy-confs
    cp _template.subdomain.conf.sample remnawave.subdomain.conf
    ```

2. Edit the configuration file

    ```bash
    nano remnawave.subdomain.conf
    ```

3. If you want, you may delete everything in the file and paste the following:

    ```nginx
    map $http_cookie $auth_cookie {
    default 0;
    "~*abcdEfgH=IJKlmnoPq" 1;
    }

    map $arg_abcdEfgH $auth_query {
        default 0;
        "IJKlmnoPq" 1;
    }

    map "$auth_cookie$auth_query" $authorized {
        "~1" 1;
        default 0;
    }

    map $arg_abcdEfgH $set_cookie_header {
        "IJKlmnoPq" "abcdEfgH=IJKlmnoPq; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict; Max-Age=31536000";
        default "";
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;

        server_name panel.*;

        include /config/nginx/ssl.conf;

        client_max_body_size 0;

        add_header Set-Cookie $set_cookie_header;

        location / {
            if ($authorized = 0) {
                return 444;
            }

            include /config/nginx/proxy.conf;
            include /config/nginx/resolver.conf;
            set $upstream_app remnawave;
            set $upstream_port 3000;
            set $upstream_proto http;
            proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port;

        }
    }

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;

        server_name subscription.*;

        include /config/nginx/ssl.conf;

        client_max_body_size 0;

        location / {
            include /config/nginx/proxy.conf;
            include /config/nginx/resolver.conf;
            set $upstream_app remnawave-subscription-page;
            set $upstream_port 3010;
            set $upstream_proto http;
            proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port;

        }

        location @redirect {
            return 404;
        }
    }
    ```

    You may get confused as a lot of strings are gone, that's because some parameters and headers are already present in SWAG's `proxy.conf` and `ssl.conf`, so you don't need to repeat them. If you want to add some headers, you add them back from `/opt/remnawave/nginx.conf`.

4. Navigate to `/path/to/swag/config/nginx/site-confs` and edit `default` file.

    ```nginx "ssl_reject_handshake on;"
    # main server block
    server {
        listen 443 ssl default_server;

        server_name _;
        ssl_reject_handshake on;
        include /config/nginx/ssl.conf;

</Steps>

## Securing SWAG

### Fail2ban / Crowdsec

Crowdsec and Fail2Ban can prevent brute-force attacks by monitoring the logs of apps and banning IPs that fail multiple login attempts.

SWAG comes with Fail2Ban pre-configured with a few basic protections, you can fine-tune it specifically for your apps, or disable it and set up Crowdsec instead.

#### Crowdsec

[Crowdsec](https://www.crowdsec.net/) is a free, open-source and collaborative IPS; it's like fail2ban but you share your bans with all of the other users to try and pre-emptively block malicious hosts.

Follow [this blog post](https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/blocking-malicious-connections-with-crowdsec-and-swag) to set it up in SWAG.

#### Fail2ban

Fail2Ban is an intrusion prevention software that protects external applications from brute-force attacks. Attackers that fail to login to your applications a certain number of times will get blocked from accessing all of your applications.  
Fail2Ban looks for failed login attempts in log files, counts the failed attempts in a short period, and bans the IP address of the attacker.

Follow [this guide](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-swag/?h=fail2ban#using-fail2ban) to set it up in SWAG.

## Configuring other services

As already said, SWAG has a lot of preset reverse proxy config files are added for popular apps. See the `README.md` file under `/config/nginx/proxy_confs` for instructions on how to enable them. The preset confs reside in and get imported from [this repo](https://github.com/linuxserver/reverse-proxy-confs).
